Micro drilling operation on Nickel Chrome alloy 625 using simulation in Deform 3D software. Simulation work helps conduct experiments, especially for hard components like Nickel Chrome alloy 625 where traditional micro-drilling experiments are expensive. Simulation can significantly reduce experimental costs.
